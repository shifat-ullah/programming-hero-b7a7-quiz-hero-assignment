            <p><b><u>qus no 1:</u></b> map, filter, foreach, find different</p>
            <br>
            <p><b><u>Answer:</u></b> Map: This method creates a new array by transforming each element in an existing array using a provided function.

                Filter: This method creates a new array that contains only the elements of an existing array that satisfy a provided condition.
                
                ForEach: This method iterates over each element in an array and performs a specified action on each element.
                
                Find: This method returns the first element in an array that satisfies a provided condition, or undefined if no such element is found.</p>

            <p><b><u>Qus no 2: </u></b> Difference between local storage, session storage and cookies</p><br>
            <p><b><u>Answer : </u></b> Local storage: This is a mechanism that allows web pages to store data in the browser, even after the user closes the tab or browser. The data is stored indefinitely and can be accessed by any page on the same domain.

                Session storage: This is similar to local storage, but the data is only stored for the duration of the user's session. The data is cleared when the user closes the tab or browser.
                
                Cookies: Cookies are small pieces of data that are sent from a website and stored on the user's computer. They can be used to store user preferences or login information and can be accessed by any page on the same domain. Cookies can have an expiration date or be session-based, and they can be managed by the browser or by the server.</p>

            <p><b><u>Qus no 3 : </u></b>What is event loop? How the event loop works .</p><br>
            <p><b><u>Answer : </u></b>the event loop is a mechanism that allows the runtime environment to handle asynchronous operations and event-driven programming, enabling JavaScript to be non-blocking and handle multiple operations simultaneously. It continuously checks the call stack and event queue, moving items from the event queue back into the call stack when the call stack is empty, allowing asynchronous operations to be executed in the background without blocking the main thread. <br> <br>
            
                The event loop in JavaScript continuously checks the call stack and event queue. When an asynchronous operation is encountered, it is moved to a separate queue known as the event queue. The event loop moves items from the event queue back into the call stack when the call stack is empty, allowing asynchronous operations to be executed in the background without blocking the main thread. This enables JavaScript to be non-blocking and handle multiple operations simultaneously.</p>
